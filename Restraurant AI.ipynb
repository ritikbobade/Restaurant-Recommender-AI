    "## Project Overview\n",
    "Finding the perfect restaurant can be challenging due to the vast number of choices available. To help users make informed decisions, we have developed Restaurant Recommender AI, a chatbot designed to assist users in finding the ideal restaurant based on their specific needs, such as cuisine preferences, dietary restrictions, location, and user reviews. This solution leverages both large language models (LLMs) and rule-based functions to provide personalized recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Build a chatbot that accurately parses a dataset containing restaurant information and provides tailored recommendations based on user requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a dataset with details about restaurants (cuisine type, dietary options, location, user reviews, etc.), develop a chatbot that can interpret this data and recommend the best restaurants according to user preferences."
