### Project Overview
Finding the perfect restaurant can be challenging due to the vast number of choices available. To help users make informed decisions, we have developed Restaurant Recommender AI, a chatbot designed to assist users in finding the ideal restaurant based on their specific needs, such as cuisine preferences, dietary restrictions, location, and user reviews. This solution leverages both large language models (LLMs) and rule-based functions to provide personalized recommendations
### Objective
1. Develop a chatbot that can accurately parse a dataset containing comprehensive information about restaurants.
2. Provide personalized restaurant recommendations based on user requirements.
3. Understand and process user preferences such as cuisine type, dietary restrictions, location, and user reviews.
4. Suggest the best dining options tailored to individual user needs.
5. Understanding the multi-stage architecture behind the fully functioning chatbot system,
6. Integrate OpenAIâ€™s Chat Completion APIs to provide a natural and contextually relevant conversation.

### Problem Statement
Given a dataset with details about restaurants (cuisine type, dietary options, location, user reviews, etc.), develop a chatbot that can interpret this data and recommend the best restaurants according to user preferences.
